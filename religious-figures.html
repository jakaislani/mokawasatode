His actions set in motion tremendous reform within the Church.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A prominent theologian, Luther’s desire for people to feel closer to God led him to translate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/religion/bible data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Bible" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the Bible</a> into the language of the people, radically changing the relationship between church leaders and their followers.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Saxony, located in modern-day Germany.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His parents, Hans and Margarette Luther, were of peasant lineage. However, Hans had some success as a miner and ore smelter, and in 1484 the family moved from Eisleben to nearby Mansfeld, where Hans held ore deposits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hans Luther knew that mining was a tough business and wanted his promising son to have a better career as a lawyer. At age seven, Luther entered school in Mansfeld.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At 14, Luther went north to Magdeburg, where he continued his studies. In 1498, he returned to Eisleben and enrolled in a school, studying grammar, rhetoric and logic. He later compared this experience to purgatory and hell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1501, Luther entered the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="University of Erfurt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">University of Erfurt</a>, where he received a degree in grammar, logic, rhetoric and metaphysics. At this time, it seemed he was on his way to becoming a lawyer.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Becoming a Monk</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In July 1505, Luther had a life-changing experience that set him on a new course to becoming a monk.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Caught in a horrific thunderstorm where he feared for his life, Luther cried out to St. Anne, the patron saint of miners, “Save me, St. Anne, and I’ll become a monk!” The storm subsided and he was saved.<br tml-linebreak=true></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Most historians believe this was not a spontaneous act, but an idea already formulated in Luther’s mind. The decision to become a monk was difficult and greatly disappointed his father, but he felt he must keep a promise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Luther was also driven by fears of hell and God’s wrath, and felt that life in a monastery would help him find salvation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first few years of monastic life were difficult for Luther, as he did not find the religious enlightenment he was seeking. A mentor told him to focus his life exclusively on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/jesus-christ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jesus Christ" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jesus Christ</a> and this would later provide him with the guidance he sought.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Disillusionment with Rome</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At age 27, Luther was given the opportunity to be a delegate to a Catholic church conference in Rome. He came away more disillusioned, and very discouraged by the immorality and corruption he witnessed there among the Catholic priests.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Upon his return to Germany, he enrolled in the University of Wittenberg in an attempt to suppress his spiritual turmoil. He excelled in his studies and received a doctorate, becoming a professor of theology at the university (known today as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.uni-halle.de/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg</a>).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Through his studies of scripture, Luther finally gained religious enlightenment. Beginning in 1513, while preparing lectures, Luther read the first line of Psalm 22, which Christ wailed in his cry for mercy on the cross, a cry similar to Luther’s own disillusionment with God and religion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two years later, while preparing a lecture on Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, he read, “The just will live by faith.” He dwelled on this statement for some time.<br tml-linebreak=true></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, he realized the key to spiritual salvation was not to fear God or be enslaved by religious dogma but to believe that faith alone would bring salvation. This period marked a major change in his life and set in motion the Reformation.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80/MTY3MDUzODI1NjQ2MDEyMDc3/martinluther_facts_desktop-1.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S MARTIN LUTHER FACT CARD" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S MARTIN LUTHER FACT CARD</a></strong></p><img alt="Martin Luther Fact Card" title="Martin Luther Fact Card" width=600 height=1434 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/martinluther_facts_desktop-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'95 Theses'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On October 31, 1517, Luther, angry with Pope Leo X’s new round of indulgences to help build <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/videos/st-peters-basilica data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="St. Peter’s Basilica" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">St. Peter’s Basilica</a>, nailed a sheet of paper with his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/martin-luther-and-the-95-theses data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="95 Theses" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">95 Theses</a> on the University of Wittenberg’s chapel door.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though Luther intended these to be discussion points, the 95 Theses laid out a devastating critique of the indulgences - good works, which often involved monetary donations, that popes could grant to the people to cancel out penance for sins - as corrupting people’s faith.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Luther also sent a copy to Archbishop Albert Albrecht of Mainz, calling on him to end the sale of indulgences. Aided by the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/printing-press data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="printing press" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">printing press</a>, copies of the 95 Theses spread throughout Germany within two weeks and throughout Europe within two months.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Church eventually moved to stop the act of defiance. In October 1518, at a meeting with Cardinal Thomas Cajetan in Augsburg, Luther was ordered to recant his 95 Theses by the authority of the pope.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Luther said he would not recant unless scripture proved him wrong. He went further, stating he didn’t consider that the papacy had the authority to interpret scripture. The meeting ended in a shouting match and initiated his ultimate excommunication from the Church.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Excommunication</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the publication of his 95 Theses, Luther continued to lecture and write in Wittenberg. In June and July of 1519 Luther publicly declared that the Bible did not give the pope the exclusive right to interpret scripture, which was a direct attack on the authority of the papacy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, in 1520, the pope had had enough and on June 15 issued an ultimatum threatening Luther with excommunication.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On December 10, 1520, Luther publicly burned the letter. In January 1521, Luther was officially excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Diet of Worms</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In March 1521, Luther was summoned before the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/luther-defiant-at-diet-of-worms data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diet of Worms" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Diet of Worms</a>, a general assembly of secular authorities. Again, Luther refused to recant his statements, demanding he be shown any scripture that would refute his position. There was none.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On May 8, 1521, the council released the Edict of Worms, banning Luther’s writings and declaring him a “convicted heretic.” This made him a condemned and wanted man. Friends helped him hide out at the Wartburg Castle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While in seclusion, he translated the New Testament into the German language, to give ordinary people the opportunity to read God’s word.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Lutheran Church</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though still under threat of arrest, Luther returned to Wittenberg Castle Church, in Eisenach, in May 1522 to organize a new church, Lutheranism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He gained many followers, and the Lutheran Church also received considerable support from German princes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When a peasant revolt began in 1524, Luther denounced the peasants and sided with the rulers, whom he depended on to keep his church growing. Thousands of peasants were killed, but the Lutheran Church grew over the years.</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Katharina von Bora</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1525, Luther married Katharina von Bora, a former nun who had abandoned the convent and taken refuge in Wittenberg.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born into a noble family that had fallen on hard times, at the age of five Katharina was sent to a convent. She and several other reform-minded nuns decided to escape the rigors of the cloistered life, and after smuggling out a letter pleading for help from the Lutherans, Luther organized a daring plot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the help of a fishmonger, Luther had the rebellious nuns hide in herring barrels that were secreted out of the convent after dark - an offense punishable by death. Luther ensured that all the women found employment or marriage prospects, except for the strong-willed Katharina, who refused all suitors except Luther himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The scandalous marriage of a disgraced monk to a disgraced nun may have somewhat tarnished the reform movement, but over the next several years, the couple prospered and had six children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Katharina proved herself a more than a capable wife and ally, as she greatly increased their family's wealth by shrewdly investing in farms, orchards and a brewery. She also converted a former monastery into a dormitory and meeting center for Reformation activists.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Luther later said of his marriage, "I have made the angels laugh and the devils weep." Unusual for its time, Luther in his will entrusted Katharina as his sole inheritor and guardian of their children.</p><h2 data-node-id=54 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Anti-Semitism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From 1533 to his death in 1546, Luther served as the dean of theology at University of Wittenberg. During this time he suffered from many illnesses, including arthritis, heart problems and digestive disorders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The physical pain and emotional strain of being a fugitive might have been reflected in his writings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some works contained strident and offensive language against several segments of society, particularly Jews and, to a lesser degree, Muslims.
