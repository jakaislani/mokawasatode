They were introduced by a mutual friend after the musician and the aforementioned friend were driving and spotted Gigi outside a Guess store, presumably in Beverly Hills.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My friend and I drove past a Guess store, and I was immediately infatuated by this chick,” Cody recalled to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Teen Vogue</a> in 2015. “She looked beautiful. My friend kind of knew her, and he said, ‘Yeah, do you want me to introduce you?’ I did!”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From there, their relationship blossomed into a full-fledged teen romance.&nbsp;He continued, “It was cool because for a while we just kind of kept it on the down-low while she was still trying to get started. Now, she's a supermodel.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>They might have been young, but they were, without a doubt, wildly in love. Gigi and Cody were known to pack on the PDA anytime, anywhere — whether in the middle of the ocean, at Coachella, or courtside at a Knicks game.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two were even called out for their nonstop kissing on the set of Cody’s music video for “Surfboard.” Cody previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us Weekly</a>, “We had a couple kisses on camera and stuff, and they honestly had to tell us to stop after they cut.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>Their steamy photoshoot for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mario Testino’s iconic “Towel Series”</a> in 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later, Cody opened up about the awkward shoot during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Huffington Post</a>. "It was a weird scenario," Simpson, who, at the time was participating in Vogue's "Hollywood's New Rat Pack" shoot, remembered. "We were shooting Vogue with Mario, and at the end of the day he was like, 'Cody, take off your clothes. I'll put a towel around you.'"&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was apprehensive at first, but Gigi eventually talked him into it.&nbsp; "Gigi was like, 'Babe, this is the Towel Series!'" he continued. "I was like, 'OK, alright, I'm in.' She's a pro at that stuff. And I was in there, and he [Testino] kept pushing the towel smaller. It started off like, more of my thigh, and then he pushed it down. We’re wearing clothes underneath the towel, but it looks pretty ... pretty funny."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">[Ed note: in 2018, 13 models and assistants came forward accusing Testino of exploitation. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a> reported that the incidents happened in the mid-1990s.]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:&nbsp;</strong>After a year of dating<strong>, </strong>Gigi and Cody broke up due to their "busy schedules," before getting back together several months later. However, they split for good in May 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're still best friends and I'll always respect him and support his career," told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Women’s Wear Daily</a> after their first breakup in 2014. "I love Cody to death and he loves me." Setting the record straight, she added, "He's the one who broke up with me."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cody then offered an entirely different reason for their split in 2015, revealing that the constant media attention was to blame for the demise of their relationship. "The highly publicized thing made me uncomfortable. Going out to dinner and there being all this paparazzi and stuff ... as soon as we split, I had the realization that I was straying away from who I was as a whole person. I want to keep it low-key, and focus on my music," Simpson told DuJour in June 2015, adding that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>their split</a> was "an amicable, mutual decision."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>Hadid moved on with Joe Jonas, before her on-again, off-again romance with musician Zayn Malik. In 2020, the pair announced that they were expecting, and later that year, they welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Khai. Sadly, Zigi didn't last and they officially broke up in October 2021. Gigi is now <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>rumored to be dating</a> Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Career-wise, Gigi, of course, went on to become one of the most in-demand supermodels — and still is. Just this past Fashion Month, Hadid walked all the major runways, including Stella McCartney, Givenchy, Versace, and Tom Ford. This year, Gigi also added fashion founder to her résumé when she launched the luxury knitwear brand Guest in Residence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gigi wasn't Cody's only high-profile relationship. He dated Lindsay Lohan's little sister, Ali, model Clair Wuestenberg, and Miley Cyrus, before settling down with professional swimmer Emma McKeon this summer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three years ago, Cody gave up his music career for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>competitive swimming</a>, and he's been quite successful. He won a gold and a silver medal in the Commonwealth Games earlier this year, and before that, he qualified for the Australian Olympic Trials for the Tokyo Games, but unfortunately, missed the mark by just 1.24 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZpufmcZuv8imp6ynnmK0qrPIZp%2BanJmZerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIxvb2tsaW2G</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftbt-cody-simpson-gigi-hadid-relationship-6824989.html&text=Cody%20Simpson%20Said%20He%20was%20%26quot%3bImmediately%20Infatuated%26quot%3b%20with%20Gigi%20Hadid&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftbt-cody-simpson-gigi-hadid-relationship-6824989.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-cody-simpson-gigi-hadid-relationship-6824989.html&title=Cody%20Simpson%20Said%20He%20was%20%26quot%3bImmediately%20Infatuated%26quot%3b%20with%20Gigi%20Hadid" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftbt-cody-simpson-gigi-hadid-relationship-6824989.html&title=Cody%20Simpson%20Said%20He%20was%20%26quot%3bImmediately%20Infatuated%26quot%3b%20with%20Gigi%20Hadid" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-cody-simpson-gigi-hadid-relationship-6824989.html&title=Cody%20Simpson%20Said%20He%20was%20%26quot%3bImmediately%20Infatuated%26quot%3b%20with%20Gigi%20Hadid" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftbt-cody-simpson-gigi-hadid-relationship-6824989.html&description=Cody%20Simpson%20Said%20He%20was%20%26quot%3bImmediately%20Infatuated%26quot%3b%20with%20Gigi%20Hadid" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emma-lavy-bradford.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Lavy Bradford- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Height, Net Worth, Career, Husband">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./clint-howard-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clint Howard Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
