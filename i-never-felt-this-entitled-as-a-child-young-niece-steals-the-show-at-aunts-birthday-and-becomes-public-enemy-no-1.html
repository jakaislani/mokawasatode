Some people love the feeling their loved ones surrounding them while getting to make a wish for a new year, while others shy away from the attention.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong> user angel_mendoza98 recently shared her moment in the spotlight with her niece, Haisley, and the video is causing quite a commotion on social channels. Angel was basking in the moment of gearing up to blow out her candles on her 25th birthday, but a sweet little someone beat her to the big moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true><a title=@angel_mendoza98 href=#>@angel_mendoza98</a><p>being an auntie aint for the weaküò© <a title=ourbday href=#>#ourbday</a> <a title=iguess href=#>#iguess</a> <a title=niece href=#>#niece</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=loveithere href=#>#loveithere</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ What Was I Made For?

This user says that at 25, it would have annoyed them, but they‚Äôd be okay with it now as a 30-year-old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-2.44.32-PM.png><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Her annoyed vibe isn‚Äôt wrong, but many wonder if someone else should have spoken up on her behalf. Should the sister have grabbed her niece to give Angel her moment? Should someone recording have noticed her frustration and tried to jump in?</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>It‚Äôs also important to note that kids, especially at the age range that Haisley looks to be, have lived much of their lives in a COVID-19 bubble. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Unicef</a> says that the pandemic has severely impacted kids, and having ‚Äúproper‚Äù social skills is the most noticeable piece.</p><p>‚ÄúIn terms of social skills, kids are out of practice. Part of how they learn how to get along with others is by spending time with people, making friends, and also by being with people they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily choose to be around. It‚Äôs with practice that children and adults get better at doing all of those things. So we are definitely seeing signs of developmental lag in some children‚Äôs social skills. This is to be expected, but it can also be addressed.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Children missed out on many things during the pandemic, like birthday parties, and Unicef says there‚Äôs nothing more important for a child coming to terms with what they‚Äôve missed than comfort from a loving adult.</p><p>‚ÄúSo when children are tearful about all they‚Äôve missed out on, they are having the right feeling at the right time. They‚Äôre handling that feeling effectively by expressing it through tears, and hopefully taking comfort from loving adults. If, however, a child is sad about all that has happened and is unable to receive or find ways to help themselves feel better, is doing things that are harmful to others or harmful to themselves, or is so sad that the sadness starts to interfere with the ability to enjoy anything or feel hopeful, then we want to treat that as a mental health concern and make sure that child gets the needed support.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>Despite Angel‚Äôs internal feelings, she gave Haisley precisely what she needed at the time ‚Äî and that says a lot about her heart.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>Another comment unexpectedly hit us right in the ‚Äúfeels,‚Äù so to speak, because it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve felt before as we tiptoe into adulthood. There‚Äôs an age that‚Äôs different for all of us, but often in your early 20s (if not before) when birthdays aren‚Äôt really celebrated on a grand scale anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-2.12.06-PM.png><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=true>Is it because we‚Äôve grown older and understand that the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of a birthday isn‚Äôt what we used to believe? Does society tell us to grow up because we‚Äôre adults now and responsibilities and demands and the things that require our attention are more important than a fancy cake and a day to celebrate ourselves? Sometimes, it comes down to aging ‚Äî are we losing the joy in celebrating because the number of candles keeps growing? Isn‚Äôt that more of a reason to honor ourselves and our bodies?</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Several comments read a lot like this: signaling that the birthday should feel lucky that her niece wants to celebrate with her, with many saying they allow their littles to blow out candles often.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-2.13.10-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-2.12.22-PM.png><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>There is something inherently special about being an aunt or an uncle; there‚Äôs a joy and pride in being given that title, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brigham Young University</a> shared an article from research assistant Kaitlin M. Miller that highlights the importance of being there for the nieces and nephews in your life.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>From being there as a type of role model, friend, advice giver, or listener, being present is the most essential step in being an aunt or uncle. It‚Äôs obvious that Angel‚Äôs niece continually feels her love and presence, and if there‚Äôs a silver lining in this ‚Äúmishap‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs that. Children can‚Äôt feel an ‚Äúoverabundance‚Äù of love; they treasure every ounce; the more, the better.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@angel_mendoza98 href=#>@angel_mendoza98</a><p>we too lit <a title=auntie href=#>#auntie</a> <a title=richauntie href=#>#richauntie</a> <a title=niece href=#>#niece</a> <a title=welit href=#>#welit</a> <a title=frozenchallenge href=#>#frozenchallenge</a> <a title=ontheside href=#>#ontheside</a> <a title=fyp„Ç∑ href=#>#fyp„Ç∑</a> <a title=fun href=#>#fun</a> <a title=relatable href=#>#relatable</a> <a title=reputation href=#>#reputation</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - DRUSKI" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì DRUSKI</a></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=false>Angel is the fun aunt, and while that video might have been tragic, we‚Äôre not sure anyone can disagree that her niece feels loved and special when she‚Äôs with her, and Angel deserves her flowers (and to blow out her own candles) for that.
