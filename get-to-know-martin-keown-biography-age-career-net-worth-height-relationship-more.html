Martin Keown made his England debut in 1992 against France and went on to win 43 caps for the national side over the next ten years, gradually forming a respected defensive partnership with Arsenal teammate Tony Adams at both club and international level.</p><p>Martin Keown represented England at four major international football finals including the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as Euro 1992 and Euro 2000. He is now a part-time scout and coach for Arsenal, as well as a pundit for the BBC and BT Sport. He came out of retirement in 2012 and briefly played for Combined Counties League Premier Division side Wembley in their FA Cup fixtures.</p><p>A center-back from Oxford, Martin Keown played for local sides and his local Gaelic football team as a boy, before joining Arsenal on a schoolboy contract in 1980, though he made his professional debut on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion in 1984.</p><p>His debut for Arsenal came on 23 November 1985, when Don Howe was still their manager, and they drew 0–0 with West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns. He played 22 league games that season, mostly alongside Tommy Caton or David O’Leary, but when George Graham was appointed manager on 14 May 1986, he decided that Martin Keown was not part of his plans to try to turn Arsenal into league title contenders and on 9 June 1986 he joined Aston Villa for £125,000.</p><p>Graham offered him £50 a week less than Martin Keown wanted and stated in 1993: ‘It seemed crazy that they wouldn’t agree and although I didn’t want to leave and they didn’t want me to go, it became a matter of principle.’ Martin Keown did not feature in Arsenal’s historic FA Cup and League Cup double of 1993 due to being cup-tied. However, he did manage 16 Premier League appearances, playing in a number of positions.</p><p>He signed for Leicester City, but left after less than six months and signed for Reading in January 2005 until the end of the season, after which he retired. As part of a publicity stunt Martin Keown, and a number of other former professional players, including Ray Parlour, Danny Dichio, Jaime Moreno, Graeme Le Saux, Claudio Caniggia, and Brian McBride, joined non-league Wembley in order to take part in their 2012–13 FA Cup run. Wembley was knocked out in a replay by Uxbridge after beating Langford in the previous round.</p><p>Martin Keown joined the coaching staff of Newbury in August 2005 but is now coaching back at his former club Arsenal where he is taking his coaching badges. Former Arsenal manager Terry Neill identified him as a key figure behind the success of Arsenal’s inexperienced “new-look” defense (which the team resorted to after ongoing injury problems in the 2005–06 season, notably setting a record for minutes played without conceding in the Champions League).</p><p>In 2007–08 Martin Keown was also a coach for the Oxford University Blues Football team on a part-time basis. He regularly appears as a pundit on the BBC’s football coverage and Match of the Day, as well as covering the Champions League for Irish broadcaster TV3. He was also working for ESPN UK during the 2011 Emirates Cup.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Nationality</h2><p>Martin Keown is English born in Oxford, United Kingdom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Net Worth</h2><p>Martin Keown is estimated to be worth around £10 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is Martin Keown from?</h2><p>Martin Keown is from Oxford, a city in central southern England, which revolves around its prestigious university, established in the 12th century.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Martin Keown?</h2><p>Martin Keown is 56 years old now as he was born on July 24, 1966.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Height & Weight</h2><p>Martin Keown stands 1.85 m tall and weighs 78 kg.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Career</h2><p>Martin Keown played for local sides and his local Gaelic football team as a boy, before joining Arsenal on a schoolboy contract in 1980, though he made his professional debut on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion in 1984. His debut for Arsenal came on 23 November 1985, when Don Howe was still their manager, and they drew 0–0 with West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.</p><p>He played 22 league games that season, mostly alongside Tommy Caton or David O’Leary, but when George Graham was appointed manager on 14 May 1986, he decided that Keown was not part of his plans to try to turn Arsenal into league title contenders and on 9 June 1986 he joined Aston Villa for £125,000.</p><p>Martin Keown signed for Villa after a season in which they had narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division, a mere four years after being European Cup winners and five years since being league champions. Keown had a fine start to his Everton career, and they topped the table for a while in late autumn there was hope that they could win the league title, but their form ebbed away after Christmas and they managed only a sixth-place finish.</p><p>Martin Keown managed 20 league appearances that campaign and a slightly better 24 in 1990–91 when Harvey was replaced by Howard Kendall as a manager in November. He missed just three league games in 1991–92, which brought another mid-table finish, and he played just 13 more league games for the Toffees before accepting a £2 million return to Arsenal in February 1993.</p><p>Martin Keown missed out on Arsenal’s Cup Winners’ Cup Final win over Parma the following year through injury although he did play a part in the overall campaign after appearing in earlier rounds. However, he did start the final the following season when Arsenal were narrowly beaten by Real Zaragoza after extra time. He made ten league appearances during the season, before being released on a free transfer in the summer of 2004 after 11 years in his second spell at the club.</p><p>Martin Keown played U16 and U18 for England. He made his England debut in 1992 against France. With an injury to Mark Wright, he was called up into England’s squad for UEFA Euro 1992 and played in all three of England’s matches.</p><p>His early ascension to the England team under Graham Taylor did not continue under Terry Venables, who ignored him completely. He earned a recall from Glenn Hoddle in 1997 and went to the 1998 World Cup, but did not play. Martin Keown became a regular under Kevin Keegan (captaining the side against Finland) and played in two of England’s Euro 2000 matches.</p><p>By the time Sven-Göran Eriksson became manager, his age was starting to count against him, though he went to the 2002 World Cup, again as a non-playing squad member. He retired from international football the day after England’s exit at the hands of Brazil. In all he played 43 times for England, scoring two goals.</p><p>Martin Keown joined the coaching staff of Newbury in August 2005 but is now coaching back at his former club Arsenal where he is taking his coaching badges. Former Arsenal manager Terry Neill identified him as a key figure behind the success of Arsenal’s inexperienced “new-look” defense (which the team resorted to after ongoing injury problems in the 2005–06 season, notably setting a record for minutes played without conceding in the Champions League). In 2007–08 Keown was also a coach for the Oxford University Blues Football team on a part-time basis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Marital Status</h2><p>Martin Keown has been married to his childhood sweetheart Nicola Keown RPO Account Director, responsible for contract delivery and executive client management since 1990 but there is no information regarding how they met.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Family & Siblings</h2><p>Martin Keown is the son of Raymond Keown an Ironworker and Angela Keown a nurse but there is no other information about them and we can’t tell if he has any other siblings or not since there is no information regarding that.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is Martin Keown famous?</h2><p>Martin Keown is famous for his time at Arsenal where he won 10 trophies, including being a part of ‘The Invincibles’ side that won the 2003-04 Premier League, and now as a coach at his former team Arsenal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Keown’s Children</h2><p>Martin Keown has two children <strong>Niall Keown</strong> is a former professional footballer who played as a defender.
