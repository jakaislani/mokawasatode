Having won massive followers and admirers, celebrities who are in love with each other apparently pull a lot of attention to themselves as fans watch carefully to see how their idols will co-exist with one another as romantic partners.

According to reports, the former couple met while they were both auditioning for the same guest spot on The Tonight Show, a popular American talk show. Sources say they first met through a pre-interview dinner which was organized by The Tonight Show. After this meeting, Téa and David picked interest in each other and got talking. Soon, they kick-started their relationship.</p><p>The couple did not make their romance a hidden thing as they were often seen together in public places such as the carpet events and at public stores where they were often seen holding hands and displaying other forms of affection openly. From what we gathered, they courted for about eight weeks during which they publicly showered each other with immense love and affection, charming fans with their romance.</p><p>Finally, Téa Leoni and David Duchovny tied the knot as husband and wife on May 13, 1997. Their wedding ceremony held inside the garden of the Grace Church School in the city of New York and was very private. In fact, the event was so private that it was only attended by very few people including close friends and some family members. Some of the people resent at the wedding included Téa Leoni’s parents and siblings. David’s mother and siblings were also present to witness the event; his brother Daniel Duchovny was the best man.</p><p>The marriage between Leoni and Duchovny produced two children; their first child, a girl called Madelaine West Duchovny was born on April 24, 1999. A few years later, they welcomed their second child, this time a son they named Kyd Miller Duchovny. He was born on June 15, 2002. During the marriage, the family lived at the Upper East Side, a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years></span><strong>What Led To Their Divorce After 17 Years?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Téa Leoni and David Duchovny remained married and lived as a happy celebrity couple for many years, earning the deep admiration of fans. While they were married, fans often hailed their union as one of the true examples of what a Hollywood marriage should look like. This was mainly because both movie stars were deemed very respectable and also very homely.</p><p>However, in 2008, several years after their wedding day, the couple started experiencing problems and their union eventually collapsed like a loose pack of cards. On the 15th day of October in 2008, the couple issued a statement through their individual lawyers that they had separated. In fact, the statement revealed that they had even separated several months before the announcement was made. This announcement stunned their many fans who initially thought the coupe was living very happily together.</p><p>The main reason for the separation of the couple was attributed to David Duchovny’s much-publicized sex addiction. The actor was reported to be a sex addict who found it really hard to control his urge for sex. As a matter of fact, on the 28th of August 2008, some months before their separation was revealed, David had announced to his many fans and admirers that he had checked himself into a rehabilitation facility for treating sex addiction.</p><p>As the story goes, the actor’s addiction caused a serious strain on his relationship with his wife and children. Many tabloid reports claimed that David was cheating on his wife with different women to satisfy his sex addiction. However, this has not been proven. At first, Téa Leoni was willing to stay in the marriage and help her husband overcome his addiction. Reports even have it that it was Téa who made him check into the rehabilitation facility. Sources revealed that she gave him an ultimatum to either get treated or get a divorce so he sought treatment. But then, this was not enough as the couple separated after some time.</p><p>Nonetheless, soon after the news of their separation emerged, another news emerged that the couple had reconciled. Téa Leoni and David Duchovny actually reconciled publicly and resolved to make their marriage work. After their reconciliation, they were seen in public many times and seemed like the perfect couple they were before. They were hailed for their tolerance for each other by their many fans.</p><p>Sadly, despite their renewed love for each other, the couple could not sustain their romance as they split again in 2011. A report by CNN on 29th June 2011 confirmed that the couple had separated for the second time years after their reconciliation. Initially, fans thought they may have divorced, but in 2012, David Duchovny explained that he was still married to Téa Leoni even though they were separated. Eventually, Téa officially filed for divorce from her husband in June 2014. Their divorce was finalized by August the same year as the couple agreed to settlement terms, ending their union after 17 years of marriage.</p><p>It is noteworthy that despite their divorce, Téa Leoni and David Duchovny are still friends and have often been seen together having good times during their family reunion with their kids. In 2018, the two were spotted enjoying a jet ski ride during a family holiday in Barbados. Photos of the former couple emerged on tabloids showing them having a great time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35utM6wZJ2hlGLBpq2MpZyopplirq%2BwjJ2Yr6GUYrG2r8eoraexXaKypsCMsJ%2BarF2hsqV506hkraCVnr9usMivpqublWKup8DEq2Rqb12usqK%2B0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2021-how-did-tea-leoni-and-david-duchovny-meet-what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years.html&text=How%20Did%20Ta%20Leoni%20and%20David%20Duchovny%20Meet%2c%20What%20Led%20To%20Their%20Divorce%20After%2017%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2021-how-did-tea-leoni-and-david-duchovny-meet-what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2021-how-did-tea-leoni-and-david-duchovny-meet-what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years.html&title=How%20Did%20Ta%20Leoni%20and%20David%20Duchovny%20Meet%2c%20What%20Led%20To%20Their%20Divorce%20After%2017%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2021-how-did-tea-leoni-and-david-duchovny-meet-what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years.html&title=How%20Did%20Ta%20Leoni%20and%20David%20Duchovny%20Meet%2c%20What%20Led%20To%20Their%20Divorce%20After%2017%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2021-how-did-tea-leoni-and-david-duchovny-meet-what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years.html&title=How%20Did%20Ta%20Leoni%20and%20David%20Duchovny%20Meet%2c%20What%20Led%20To%20Their%20Divorce%20After%2017%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2021-how-did-tea-leoni-and-david-duchovny-meet-what-led-to-their-divorce-after-17-years.html&description=How%20Did%20Ta%20Leoni%20and%20David%20Duchovny%20Meet%2c%20What%20Led%20To%20Their%20Divorce%20After%2017%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meryem-uzerli.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meryem Uzerli  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./an-awesome-oscar-isaac-movie-is-blowing-up-on-streaming.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="An Awesome Oscar Isaac Movie Is Blowing Up On Streaming">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
