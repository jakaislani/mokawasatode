So, what exactly do these terms mean?
These terms refer to temperament. Hotblood horses tend to be energetic, bold, and reactive. They were bred for their speed and tend to be used in racing. Coldblood horses, on the other hand, tend to be much calmer and gentler than their hotblooded cousins. They are typically taller and heavier, too, since they tend to be used as workhorses.</description></item><item><title>Will there be a The Grinch 2 movie?</title><link>/will-there-be-a-the-grinch-2-movie.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/will-there-be-a-the-grinch-2-movie.html</guid><description>The Facebook movie poster industrial complex is at it again — and just in time for Christmas!
