They require minimal care and are easy to catch. They don't live too long, but as temporary pets go, they don't come much cuter.<h2>Do ladybugs have teeth?</h2>The better question here is, "Can they bite?" not just "Do they bite?"

They are the least toxic ladybug species.<h2>Are ladybugs pee poisonous?</h2>Ladybugs do not produce a liquid pee as mammals do; they instead make a concentrated version known as uric acid.
