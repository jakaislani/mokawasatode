In an interview, she said that after matriculating, she had decided to forgo college, which was not meet with cheers and approval, Liane said: “Surprisingly, Filipino parents are strict. They were like, ‘You have to go to college. Both your sisters went to college and graduated.’ Reportedly her parents gave her four years to make something of herself before forcing her to enroll at college.</p><p>After coming to terms with her parents, she moved to Los Angeles in 2006. Back then, she had quite a chaotic schedule; at night, she would attend acting and dancing classes, while during the day she would work at a car dealership, Liane&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>said</a>:” I was really just trying to get my feet wet in the industry.

In addition, she is also an aspiring singer; one of the first videos she posted on her channel was the music video for her single entitled “Strong”.</p><p>Given her huge interest in make-up and lifestyle blogging, she has made numerous tutorials for various looks, Q& A videos, and challenges, such as “Smell It Challenge”, “Halloween Mummy Transformation”, and “Q&A with Liane V”.</p><p>In 2016 she released a couple of more music videos, entitled “Mood”, “No Cuffs”, and “Curious”.</p><p>Her music style can be described as a combination of old r&b and pop influences, drawing her inspiration from icons such as Aliayah, Mariah Carey, and Arian Grande.</p><p>While her channel and social media popularity skyrocketed, Liane always had the intention of pursuing fashion and make-up as a career, besides just making tutorials and sharing tips.

You’re literally your own business, and people don’t understand. They’re like, ‘Oh, you just shoot stupid for fun.’ It’s not. It’s a lot of work.” She also said that her key to success was her humorous and relatable content, <a rel=nofollow href=#>sayi</a>ng ”She’s just like me! That girl from Modesto. She hangs out with her dad and her friends, and they make silly videos0. Making people laugh is a powerful thing. If you can make someone laugh or smile, they look forward to you.

We are human, you know.”</p><p>However, after a couple of months, it became clear that they decided to go separate ways, and Liane opened about it in&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>the video</a>&nbsp;entitled “How I’m Healing From My Breakup”. In the video, she shared some tips which helped her through the process, such as meditating, praying, and directing her thoughts.

In&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>the video</a>, Liane said:” Not all the time the situation ends up where the couple ends up together. But in some situations, it is possible. The number one thing if you want growth, change, and to build the trust, you have to believe that people can change .”</p><p>The couple has recently gone on vacation together and has swum with the sharks, posting some photos on their social media.
