Liane was born under the Zodiac sign of Leo on 22 August 1986 in San Jose, California, USA, of Filipino ethnicity. She holds American nationality, and as of mid-2021, she is 34 years old.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_Family>Early life and Family</span></h2><p>Liane was&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>born to</a>&nbsp;Wally Valenzuela and Prima Valenzuela, who used to run a DJ company in Modesto.

Even though the information about her educational background is scarce, it‚Äôs known that she was very active physically during her high school years, as she competed in gymnastics, basketball and cheerleading.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Soaking up every moment üåä So excited to be traveling the next few months üòç Comment a place I should explore next! ‚úàÔ∏è <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/cUwGakJw9N</a></p><p>‚Äî Liane V (@LianeV) <a rel=nofollow href=#>June 11, 2021</a></p><p>Liane additionally attended various institutions such as Madonna Grimes dance classes, Ruskin School of acting, Burbank School of Ballet, and Vocal Training. In an interview, she said that after matriculating, she had decided to forgo college, which was not meet with cheers and approval, Liane said: ‚ÄúSurprisingly, Filipino parents are strict. They were like, ‚ÄòYou have to go to college. Both your sisters went to college and graduated.‚Äô Reportedly her parents gave her four years to make something of herself before forcing her to enroll at college.</p><p>After coming to terms with her parents, she moved to Los Angeles in 2006. Back then, she had quite a chaotic schedule; at night, she would attend acting and dancing classes, while during the day she would work at a car dealership, Liane&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>said</a>:‚Äù I was really just trying to get my feet wet in the industry. Before social media, it was just the work that you put in, and showing your face.‚Äù</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Although many recognize Liane for her YouTube channel, she was previously very active on the Vine platform. She began her career as a social media star posting short humorous videos on Vine, and also collaborating with other Viners such as her ex-boyfriend King Bach, Amanda Cerny and Anwar Jibaw. In an interview, she disclosed that she had launched her Vine account at her friend‚Äôs proposal, and in no time her skits started going viral. Soon the aspiring actress and model scored her first social media deal, after gaining popularity on Vine, <a rel=nofollow href=#>saying</a> ‚ÄúI still have that check at home, and I could not believe I made a couple thousand for a six-second video,‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄòYo, I was working at the car dealership for a week and didn‚Äôt even make this kind of money. Even a hundred dollars, I was like, ‚ÄòHell yeah! I got paid.‚Äù After realizing that one could make a career and a living off social media, she began investing more time and effort into her videos and content.</p><p>She has also dipped her toes in the&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>acting profession</a>, appearing in an interactive news show in 2012. In 2014 she posted a fitness video entitled ‚ÄúWorkout with Liane‚Äù, which garnered a lot of views and brought her popularity. Two years later she appeared in the short video entitled ‚ÄúMissing Heart‚Äù. In 2017 she starred in the series‚Äô ‚ÄúCaught The Series‚Äù and ‚ÄúBad Escorts‚Äù, and the same year she made a guest appearance on ‚ÄúGoin‚Äô Raw with Timothy Delaghetto‚Äù.</p><p>After the shut-down of Vine, like many other Viners, Liane transitioned to YouTube, launching her channel in 2015 and expanding her fan base and content reach. In addition, she is also an aspiring singer; one of the first videos she posted on her channel was the music video for her single entitled ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù.</p><p>Given her huge interest in make-up and lifestyle blogging, she has made numerous tutorials for various looks, Q& A videos, and challenges, such as ‚ÄúSmell It Challenge‚Äù, ‚ÄúHalloween Mummy Transformation‚Äù, and ‚ÄúQ&A with Liane V‚Äù.</p><p>In 2016 she released a couple of more music videos, entitled ‚ÄúMood‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo Cuffs‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCurious‚Äù.</p><p>Her music style can be described as a combination of old r&b and pop influences, drawing her inspiration from icons such as Aliayah, Mariah Carey, and Arian Grande.</p><p>While her channel and social media popularity skyrocketed, Liane always had the intention of pursuing fashion and make-up as a career, besides just making tutorials and sharing tips. Her prayers were heard in the same lucky 2017 when the ‚ÄúGuess‚Äù founder, Paul Marciano,&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>presented</a>&nbsp;her a deal that she couldn‚Äôt refuse. He offered her a fashion line in collaboration with G by Guess, which featured fancy dresses for holidays, as well as lace maxi dresses. She has also collaborated with a variety of other&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>brands</a>, including CoverGirl, Nike and&nbsp;Maybelline.</p><p>The following year she released more singles and music videos, including ‚ÄúOut of This World‚Äù, ‚ÄúShould I let You Go‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNo More‚Äù.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebiography.org///thebiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/D9SXKDQUwAEixf7-819x1024.jpg><p>She is still very adamant about pursuing a singing career, as she continues to make videos and record singles; one of her latest songs released on YouTube is ‚ÄúWho You Are‚Äù.</p><p>Currently, her YouTube is flooded with tutorials, house tours, and story-time videos such as ‚ÄúTeaching My Sister How To Do Make-Up‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCleaning Out My Closet‚Äù.&nbsp; Her channel has nearly 500,000 followers with more than 300 videos.</p><h2><span id=Enterprenurial_endeavor>Enterprenurial endeavor</span></h2><p>In 2019, Liane launched her own&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>merchandise</a>, which features a variety of clothing items, ‚Äòphone cases, and gym wear.

She uses her account to promote her merchandise, funny clips and make-up videos.</p><p>However, her Instagram&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>account</a>&nbsp;doesn‚Äôt fall short, which at the moment has 4.5 million followers, which she mainly uses to post photos from her travels and upcoming projects. She is also active on Facebook, which has 1.3 million followers. Liane is represented by JGO Agency.</p><p>While many have the opinion that being an Influencer or YouTuber is easy and that everybody can do it, Liane assures us that it‚Äôs not, she said: ‚ÄùA misconception people have for us influencers is that they think it‚Äôs easy, and it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre literally your own business, and people don‚Äôt understand. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOh, you just shoot stupid for fun.‚Äô It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a lot of work.‚Äù She also said that her key to success was her humorous and relatable content, <a rel=nofollow href=#>sayi</a>ng ‚ÄùShe‚Äôs just like me! That girl from Modesto. She hangs out with her dad and her friends, and they make silly videos0. Making people laugh is a powerful thing. If you can make someone laugh or smile, they look forward to you. You‚Äôre their positive thing in the day.‚Äù</p><h2><span id=Personal_life>&nbsp;Personal life</span></h2><p>In 2014 Liane&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>dated the popular</a>&nbsp;YouTuber, actor, and social media star Andre Bachelor, better known as King Bach.

Even though he was present in public life, making videos for YouTube and Vine, he additionally gained fame for starring in Ariana Grande‚Äôs music video for the song ‚ÄúInto You‚Äù, which currently has over 830 million views.</p><p>The couple collaborated on numerous projects together, starring in each other‚Äôs videos, and even launched a joint YouTube channel entitled ‚ÄúForever Us‚Äù, which has nearly 200,000 subscribers. Everything seemed to be going fine as they continued making videos, and in 2019, Don proposed to Liane on her birthday, documented in the video posted to their channel entitled ‚ÄúThe Sweetest Surprise Proposal Ever‚Äù.</p><p>While the fans were at the edge of their seat, expecting the announcement for the wedding date, some fans noticed that things might have headed south, and in January 2020, they posted a video ‚ÄúWe Are Taking a Break‚Äù,&nbsp;Liane saying ‚ÄúTo be honest we are going through a difficult time right now and we need to focus on ourselves and need to figure out what is going on between us because there are some things that we need to work on. We are human, you know.‚Äù</p><p>However, after a couple of months, it became clear that they decided to go separate ways, and Liane opened about it in&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>the video</a>&nbsp;entitled ‚ÄúHow I‚Äôm Healing From My Breakup‚Äù. In the video, she shared some tips which helped her through the process, such as meditating, praying, and directing her thoughts. After the break-up, many fans wanted to know what happened that made this famous couple part their ways after so many years together. Soon the rumors about Don‚Äôs infidelity resurfaced, which were later confirmed in the video they posted to their channel entitled ‚ÄúWhy We Broke UP‚Äù.</p><p>Both Don and Liane discussed his infidelity, and how it affected Liane, she said: ‚ÄùDuring the time I was hurt, I didn‚Äôt wanna hear anyone‚Äôs advice. I was in pain. He hurt me. I don‚Äôt deserve this. I am worth more. I don‚Äôt deserve somebody lying to me cheating on me. I reached that point. .‚Äù However, they decided to work on this issue together, mainly Don, who now swears that he is a changed man. Don even published&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>the book</a>&nbsp;entitled ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù, in which he discusses his journey to success, but also opens up about his infidelities and his growth as a man. In&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>the video</a>, Liane said:‚Äù Not all the time the situation ends up where the couple ends up together. But in some situations, it is possible. The number one thing if you want growth, change, and to build the trust, you have to believe that people can change .‚Äù</p><p>The couple has recently gone on vacation together and has swum with the sharks, posting some photos on their social media. Liane <a rel=nofollow href=#>wrote</a>: ‚ÄúMastering peace. Finally get to check this off my bucket list! ‚úîCan‚Äôt believe I got to swim with sharks in the ocean!‚Äù</p><h2><span id=Physical_stats_and_Hobbies>Physical stats and Hobbies</span></h2><p>Liane‚Äôs natural hair color is brown, further adorned with brown eyes.
