An atrophy due to the injection of quinine paralyzes the left leg at a very young age. Very young, Eboa Lotin experienced moments of discouragement and despair, he starts playing music at the age of eight. In 1962 , he was only 20 when he composed his first song Mulema mam(my heart). In this song, he tells the story of a young, inexperienced couple in which the husband gives his wife a divorce because he does not have enough money to satisfy the excessive ambitions of his wife.

It is also Eboa Lotina track by Cameroonian singer-songwriter Eboa Lotin and a song that defines him: he honestly speaks (sings), like what he would expect of a self-respecting radio to broadcast, about life and its social events, good and bad without sweeping anything under the rug.</p><p>In spite of his relatively small amount of releases (about 70 songs and an unfinished album), he is one of the best known and treasured African singer-songwriters of his generation, as well as one of the few ambassador-storytellers deemed griots by talent (as opposed to by blood) in Africa, from Ivory Coast to Gabon via Benin, Central Africa, Cameroon, DR Congo and further.</p><p>He spoke many languages including his native Duala but also Lingala which gave him high popularity in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries that shared the language. Thanks to his bringing his music and languages across countries, many tribes realised a fact that started to be buried with the oral knowledge of the ancestors and the times: that tribes define themselves beyond the artificial borders of profiting-man-made countries.</p><p>His music is simple and without frills, maybe because as he would say he knew nothing about music theory. However his talent is undeniable and his melodies still haunt today’s generations from Cameroon and the rest of Africa to far beyond, in Western countries as well as Latin America. He persisted pass discouragement, against all odds, until he eventually met to success. Self-taught, he was an artist first, excelling in music and sculpture.</p><p>His personality transpired in his songs, with fun and laughter in some songs, cries and pain in others exploring the wide range of social issues. His website reports that he remained the same humble man with the same prayer to God “Winning the law suit against the stomach and make a report to the sceptic tank</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmq%2BwrYylpq2hnmKvqrvGq5ipoKlirqixjJ%2BYpqGcrnqktMilm6udnmKwor7EnqlmnJWWwam%2FjJqlnWWemsS0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html&text=Eboa%20Lotin%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Career%2c%20Deaths%20and%20News&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html&title=Eboa%20Lotin%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Career%2c%20Deaths%20and%20News" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html&title=Eboa%20Lotin%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Career%2c%20Deaths%20and%20News" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html&title=Eboa%20Lotin%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Career%2c%20Deaths%20and%20News" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feboa-lotin-biography-age-family-children-career-deaths-and-news.html&description=Eboa%20Lotin%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Career%2c%20Deaths%20and%20News" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gigabyte-x99-gaming-g1-wifi-motherboard-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="In The Box, Test Setup and Overclocking">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./scenic-circle-to-open-two-new-hotels-in-south-island.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scenic Circle to open two new hotels in South Island">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
