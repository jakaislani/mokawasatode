He drove cars for the Sadler brothers, Michael Kranefuss, Roger Penske, T.W. Taylor, Cale Yarborough, Ray Evernham, Bill Davis, and Gene Haas. In 2009, Mayfield drove for Mayfield Motorsports which is his own team. Currently, he competes at local dirt tracks around the northwest of the state of Georgia.</strong><span id=more-89900></span></p><p>He also drove for <strong>Michael Kranefuss</strong>, <strong>Roger Penske</strong>, <strong>Ray Evernham</strong>, <strong>Bill Davis</strong>, and <strong>Gene Haas</strong>. Mayfield started racing in his native Owensboro, Kentucky, hustling BMX bikes. Before long, he got down to business for Sadler Siblings Hustling as a fabricator before turning into their driver and winning Late Model Youngster of the Year at Kentucky Engine Speedway in 1987. In 2012 he paid a fine of $1 million because his dog made scratches on the delivery man.</p><p>He started the 2001 season with two back-to-back third-place finishes but was, however, discharged after the Security One 400. Jeremy then drove for the Penske Racing South team. He ran 20 begins in his debut season, his best completion a nineteenth at Rockingham.</p><p>In 1995, Jeremy raced for Yarborough full-time and had an eighth-place keep running at the Mill operator Certified Draft 500, with a 31st-place complete in the focus standings in the wake of meeting all requirements for 27 out of 31 races.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-mayfield-age></span><strong>Jeremy Mayfield Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mayfield is 51 years old as of 2020, he was born on May 27, 1969, in Owensboro, Kentucky in the United States of America. He celebrates his birthday on May 27th every year and his birth sign is Gemini.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-mayfield-height></span>Jeremy Mayfield Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mayfield is quite tall in stature.

Our efforts to find out more about his <strong>family</strong> came to no avail as no such information is publicly available. Thus, the identity of <strong>Mayfield’s parents</strong> is still unclear. It is also not known if he has any siblings. We will update this section once this information is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-mayfield-wife></span><strong>Jeremy Mayfield Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He married Christine Keith in 1993 and the two separated in 2001.

The house was once reportedly valued at $1.8 million. Everything in the seven-bath house, seven-bedroom was stripped down from the windows to the wiring. Mayfield was evicted from the property in 2012 after financial troubles stemming from a failed drug test in 2009 that banned him from racing.</p><p>Neighbors Chris Shook and his mother Crystal Shook live across the street and watched as it went down. Mayfield bought the home and surrounding property for $3.8 million in 2006. Neighbors said Mayfield had made efforts to redecorate the home, but when he was restricted from racing and apprehended for possession of meth and stolen property, work on the home came to a sudden stop. Catawba Fire Chief Donald Robinson remembers it when it was first built back in the 1990s. Mayfield told Channel 9 he had no plans to watch the home burn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-mayfield-2019></span><strong>Jeremy Mayfield 2019</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s been over nine years since Jeremy Mayfield was banned from NASCAR after testing positive for meth. The controversy ruined his career in the sport; despite Mayfield’s repeated denials, some were left thinking the driver was an addict. But now, new occurrences have those people starting to believe his side of the story. Once news broke Aug. 6, 2019 that NASCAR CEO and Chairman Brian France was arrested for driving under the influence and possession of Oxycodone; social media was flooded with Mayfield supporters.</p><p>It took nine years to prove it, but it turns out Mayfield’s claims were right. The powerful leader who banned him for failing a drug test was using drugs himself. Mayfield feels he has been proven right on a number of other accounts as well. But when the news broke about France, Mayfield didn’t respond with joy or attack France’s character.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-mayfield-auction-results></span><strong>Jeremy Mayfield Auction Results</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mayfield has become an auction fanatic. Only this time, he was selling his own stuff, ranging from a second home, land, cars, dirt bikes and bulldozers to weed-whackers, humidifiers, and sunglasses. If it was all sold by the end of the day it would be worth about $5 million, the money needed to help his ongoing court fight to be reinstated to the sport. And for a guy who claims that “All I’ve ever known was racing,” it was an odd sight. Most of the crowd consisted of auction veterans. Few paid any attention to Mayfield’s presence, instead of staring at their seller sheets and fellow bidders.</p><p>And besides a few old pieces of sheet metal for sale and the racing hats worn by some of the visitors, there were few signs of NASCAR on the premises. “Sold for $15! What’s your number?” the auctioneer yelled after selling a circular saw blade. Mayfield walked around his land with a smile but also determined to prove that he’s not a drug user. His wife, selling clothes and shoes in another section of the facility, took a harder stand against how others in the sport have treated them.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-jeremy-mayfield></span>Frequently asked questions about <strong>Jeremy Mayfield</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jeremy-mayfield></span>Who is <strong>Jeremy Mayfield</strong>?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mayfield is an American stock car racing driver who was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, United States.
