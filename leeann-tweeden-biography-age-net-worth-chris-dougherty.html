Since February 2017, she has been the news anchor for McIntyre in the Morning on Radio 790 KABC in Los Angeles.</strong></p><p>Leeann Tweeden is the News Anchor for McIntyre In The Morning on 790 KABC Radio in Los Angeles. She joins Host Doug McIntyre from 5-10am PST M-F. Previously, Tweeden co-hosted LA Today with Rogin & Tweeden on AM570 LA Sports Radio.</p><p>As a social & political commentator, Leeann is frequently asked to appear on TV shows. Over the years, she has appeared as a regular on Hannity (Fox News), Dr. Drew (HLN), Red-Eye (Fox News) and Good Day LA (Fox 11, KTTV). Leeann is currently on hiatus from her popular podcast, Tomboys, with partner Dana Commendatore. Guests have included Michael Strahan, Gene Simmons of KISS, Tom Arnold, Dr. Drew, Julie Benz & Kelly Slater.</p><p>From 2012-2013, she co-hosted UFC Tonight on FOX SPORTS 1. Along with former fighters Chael Sonnen & Kenny Florian, the show covered the weekly news of the highly popular Ultimate Fighting Championship & other mixed martial art fighters. Leeann worked all through her pregnancy and finally left the show when she had her first child.</p><p>In 2011, Leeann co-anchored Good Day LA beside veteran broadcaster, Steve Edwards. She also hosted Angels Weekly and contributed to Angels Live for Fox Sports West for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball team that season.</p><p>For over four years, Leeann was the host of NBC’s National Heads-Up Poker Championship and the popular late-night show, Poker After Dark, which aired six days a week. (Currently, you can find re-runs of Poker After Dark on the NBC Sports Network). Poker was not a new venture for Leeann, as she was a co-host on the Mansion Poker Dome Challenge on FSN in 2006.</p><p>Before moving to NBC, the award-winning sportscaster could be seen on Fox Sports and was one of the first females to host two different action sports shows for the network, BlueTorch and 54321. She’s appeared on the talk shows Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Craig Kilborn Show and has done many radio appearances on Loveline and Adam Corolla. She even had her own racing column in Stuff Magazine. She’s often invited on news shows such as Your World with Neil Cavuto, The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch & Scarborough Country.</p><p>In January 2002, Leeann became a cast member on FSN’s The Best Damn Sports Show Period. This occurred after originally coming on as a guest, thus solidifying her in the world of mainstream sports. She frequently appeared on the panel with host and comedian Tom Arnold, as well as ex-pro athletes such as Michael Strahan, John Kruk, and John Salley.</p><p>While appearing on this show, Leeann flew with the Navy’s Blue Angels and skydived with the Army’s Golden Knights. She learned what it was like to be a professional bull rider and rodeo clown. She spent time at various NFL training camps learning how to play different positions from the pros, and with MLB’s best at Spring Training learning to throw a curveball and playing the ‘hot corner’. She’s covered the Daytona 500 numerous times, as well as many Superbowls, World Series, and the Kentucky Derby. She also had her weekly Best Damn Insider segment that covered the inside worlds of sports and entertainment.</p><p>In 2005, Leeann moved part-time to Charlotte, NC to host the NASCAR lifestyle show NASCAR Nation on SPEED. She was hired for this show due to her racing background and insight into the sport. While there, Leeann proudly filmed a public service announcement warning teens against the perils of drunk driving.</p><p>Leeann has used her celebrity status to help promote various causes including The USO, The Boot Campaign, The Achilles Team of Wounded Veterans, breast cancer research, The Special Olympics, and charities to help the children of fallen service members.</p><p>She has done 16 USO Tours around the world and has gone overseas to the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, to visit the troops on 14 different occasions. This includes almost every Thanksgiving or Christmas since the attacks on 9/11. She’s traveled numerous times with Robin Williams, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Kid Rock, Gary Sinise, Wayne Newton, John Elway, Matt Lauer and multiple Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others.</p><p>She is a frequent visitor to Walter Reed, Brooke Army Medical Center and the Center for the Intrepid to visit with our wounded warriors. This is something close to her heart as she’s a military wife and her father was an Air Force chief mechanic who served in Vietnam.</p><p>The VFW awarded Leeann their 2011 Hall of Fame Award for her ‘outstanding contribution to America’s Armed Forces in the form of entertainment.’ In 2008 and from the recommendation of friend Gary Sinise, The USO of Illinois presented Leeann with the Heart of a Patriot award for her work entertaining the troops.</p><p>In 2011, Leeann and local California businessman William Snell started their own non-profit organization called Heroes & Patriots, to help wounded warriors and military families in need. Go to www.heroesandpatriots.net for more information.</p><p>Leeann was born and raised in the Washington, DC suburb of Manassas, Virginia. Her dad and brother raced cars and go-karts while growing up and her uncle was a track announcer. You could say she was born into a racing family. Leeann graduated from high school in 3 years at the age of 16. Instead of going straight to college, Leeann wanted to follow her dreams of moving to Hollywood and giving modeling and showbiz a shot. She packed up her bags and did so at the age of 18. Once there, she was soon cast as a spokesmodel on Ed McMahon’s famous talent show, Star Search, launching her television career.</p><p>Leeann also spent years modeling in Los Angeles before she auditioned for and beat out 30,000 other women for the ESPN workout show Fitness Beach. The program was the number one rated fitness show of its time according to the New York Times.</p><p>Over the years, Leeann has been the focus of numerous magazine covers and articles that range from health and fitness to lifestyle, to popular men’s magazines like Maxim, FHM and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Leeann currently resides in Los Angeles with her husband and two young children.</p><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt kno-fb-ctx gsmt" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-ved=2ahUKEwi7_pCn0Z_iAhUwzIUKHT7_B58Q3B0oATAaegQIDxAd><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-age></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was born to parents of Spanish, Filipino, and Norwegian ancestry, Miss Tweeden grew up in Virginia as a self-proclaimed “tomboy”.

She receives her annual salary of <strong>$1 million</strong>, which has boosted her net worth. She works at a Hooters restaurant, and she was indulged in their 1994 calendar.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-chris-dougherty></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Chris Dougherty</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is married to Chris Dougherty, a retired Air Force pilot for the California Air National Guard, during a USO tour. They met and got married in 2010. The couple is blessed with two children, son Kane, and daughter Kaia. She considers herself fiscally conservative and said that she voted twice for President George W. Bush. She later became the public face of the website Rethinking Autism, which uses a series of videos to educate the public about autism.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-facebook></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Facebook</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-al-franken></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Al Franken</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>New Yorker journalist Jane Mayer has been promoting her new piece about Al Franken as an exculpatory tale. “Almost NOTHING His Main Accuser Said checks out,” Mayer tweeted Monday morning, describing her 12,000-plus-word investigation into the allegations of harassment and misbehavior that eight women levied against the then-senator in 2017. In another tweet, Mayer said that Franken was “railroaded.” In response to the executive editor of Lawfare, who accused Mayer of “rewriting history,” she tweeted, “Sometimes the first draft of history is wrong- especially when no one fact checks it.”</p><p>Mayer’s fact-checking does poke plenty of holes in the story told by conservative radio host Leeann Tweeden, whose breasts Franken can be seen pretending to grope (or possibly actually groping) in the photo that kicked off a rash of accusations against him. The image, which was taken while Tweeden was sleeping, comes from a 2006 USO tour.</p><p>Tweeden claimed that it was snapped on Dec. 24, as a final insult from Franken after a stretch of teasing; that Franken had said he’d written a kiss into a skit they performed together specifically so he’d get to kiss Tweeden; that she’d expressed her discomfort to Franken and others; that Franken had “badgered” her into rehearsing the kiss and stuck his tongue in her mouth; and that she never let Franken get close to her face after that first rehearsal.</p><p>Mayer found that the photo was taken on Dec. 21, that Franken had written the skit years earlier and performed it with other women, and that Tweeden had continued performing the skit with Franken for the rest of the tour. She was unable to find anyone to corroborate Tweeden’s contemporaneous discomfort, and a retired military pilot told Mayer it would be unlikely that Franken and Tweeden would have been left alone to rehearse a skit.</p><p>I have argued that Franken was right to resign, that his resignation not only saved the Democratic Party’s reputation but set an important standard (or perhaps, disseminated a cautionary tale) for male politicians who could stand to think a little harder about how they should be treating women. Coming from that perspective, reading Mayer’s piece was a surreal experience. Almost none of the facts Mayer presents to exonerate Franken serve that purpose. Rather, they add up to a misreading of the MeToo movement and a miscasting of what the allegations against Franken were actually about.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-fredericks-of-hollywood></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Fredericks Of Hollywood</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt kno-fb-ctx gsmt" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-ved=2ahUKEwi7_pCn0Z_iAhUwzIUKHT7_B58Q3B0oATAaegQIDxAd><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-youtube></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Youtube</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt kno-fb-ctx gsmt" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-ved=2ahUKEwi7_pCn0Z_iAhUwzIUKHT7_B58Q3B0oATAaegQIDxAd><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-twitter></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by LeeannTweeden</p><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt kno-fb-ctx gsmt" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-ved=2ahUKEwi7_pCn0Z_iAhUwzIUKHT7_B58Q3B0oATAaegQIDxAd><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-instagram></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2 class="kno-ecr-pt kno-fb-ctx gsmt" data-local-attribute=d3bn data-ved=2ahUKEwi7_pCn0Z_iAhUwzIUKHT7_B58Q3B0oATAaegQIDxAd><span class=ez-toc-section id=leeann-tweeden-facebook-2></span><span>Leeann Tweeden Facebook</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fobKmrc2nZK2vlZqxprqMm6Con6KWvanFjJqenmWemsFuw86rq6Flk52%2Fqr%2BMnaaun5iav7XFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fleeann-tweeden-biography-age-net-worth-chris-dougherty.html&text=Leeann%20Tweeden%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Chris%20Dougherty&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleeann-tweeden-biography-age-net-worth-chris-dougherty.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleeann-tweeden-biography-age-net-worth-chris-dougherty.html&title=Leeann%20Tweeden%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Chris%20Dougherty" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fleeann-tweeden-biography-age-net-worth-chris-dougherty.html&title=Leeann%20Tweeden%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Chris%20Dougherty" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fleeann-tweeden-biography-age-net-worth-chris-dougherty.html&title=Leeann%20Tweeden%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Chris%20Dougherty" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleeann-tweeden-biography-age-net-worth-chris-dougherty.html&description=Leeann%20Tweeden%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Chris%20Dougherty" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-kristi-kajak-details-to-know-about-her-husband-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Kristi Kajak?
