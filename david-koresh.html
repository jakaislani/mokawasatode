On February 28, 1993, the ATF attempted to raid the Mount Carmel Center and serve its warrants. A four-hour gunfight erupted that killed six of Koresh’s followers and four ATF agents.

Agents communicated with Koresh and other cult members inside by telephone. During the first days of the siege, Koresh released some of the children from the compound in exchange for the FBI playing recorded messages by Koresh on the radio. At one point, Koresh agreed to surrender himself and allow the rest of his followers to exit the compound peacefully, but he later changed his mind, with one of his followers saying <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.justice.gov/archives/publications/waco/evaluation-handling-branch-davidian-stand-waco-texas-february-28-april-19-1993 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“God had told Koresh to wait.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“God had told Koresh to wait.”</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to the FBI, Koresh claimed to be Christ during the negotiations, and he repeatedly went on rambling sermons during their phone calls.
